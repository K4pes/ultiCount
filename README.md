# Ulticount...
... is an Open Source Connect IQ App for your Garmin Device that wonâ€™t make you play better Ultimate Frisbee, but it will _assist_ you in keeping the score as well as tracking what the gender ratio should be! In true ABBA style.

## Features
![alt text](https://github.com/K4pes/ultiCount/blob/main/ScreenCaptures/Screenshot_fr165_gameplay_annotated.png "Game view in UltiCount")
- Game & point clock
- Tracking of score & gender ratio (incl. setting initial gender ratio)
- Time limit reminders at the start of points (When should the offence indicate they are ready etc.)

## Aim/Vision
This app aims to provide all the information needed to be help keep track of the game essentials as a game advisor might need them. To that end, this app will remain free of charges. However I don't want to exlude the possibility that one day there might also be a paid version of this App. Should that version ever exist I would imagine it to cater more towards the needs of a coach/team manager than a game advisor.

## Usage
- Press the start/enter button to start the game clock.
- To add or remove scores, swipe up or press the back/lap button.
- For all other functions, swipe down or press the down button.
    - Changing initial gender ratio
    - About/Info page
    - exiting the App

I'm interested in hearing:
- how the app works on your device, especially around the layout of icons.
- which device you wish the app would also run on (so that you can use it?)
- how the app could be made better.
