# Ulticount...
... is an Open Source Connect IQ App for your Garmin Device that wonâ€™t make you play better Ultimate Frisbee, but it will _assist_ you in keeping the score as well as tracking what the gender ratio should be! In true ABBA style.  
Install the app from [here in Garmin IQ Store](https://apps.garmin.com/apps/c9a21d52-470b-422e-9566-a70e8c52384d)

## Features
<img src="https://github.com/K4pes/ultiCount/blob/main/ScreenCaptures/Screenshot_fr165_gameplay_annotated_125DPI.png" width="600" />  
  
- Game & point clock
- Tracking of score & gender ratio (incl. setting initial gender ratio)
- Time limit reminders at the start of points (When should the offence indicate they are ready etc.)

## Aim/Vision
This app aims to provide all the information needed to be help keep track of the game essentials as a game advisor might need them. To that end, this app will remain free of charges. However I don't want to exlude the possibility that one day there might also be a paid version of this App. Should that version ever exist I would imagine it to cater more towards the needs of a coach/team manager than a game advisor.

## Usage
- Press the start/enter button to start the game clock.
- To add or remove scores, swipe up or press the back/lap button.
- For all other functions, swipe down or press the down button.
    - Changing initial gender ratio
    - About/Info page
    - exiting the App
  
Be sensible, apps crash, it never harms to have an actual physical scoreboard around if you're in charge of keeping score for an important game!

I'm definitely interested in hearing:
- How the app works on your device, especially in regards to the layout of icons.
- Which device you wish the app would also run on (so that you can use it?).
- How the app could be made better.
- Any new features you would like to see. Please keep the [vision](#aimvision) of this app in mind though.
